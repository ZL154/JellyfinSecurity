# 🔐 Two-Factor Authentication for Jellyfin

A native server-side 2FA plugin that **enforces verification on every login** using TOTP authenticator apps, recovery codes, or email OTP. Built around a per-device trust model so users only enter codes when needed.

> **Why this exists:** Reverse-proxy 2FA (Authelia, Authentik) breaks native Jellyfin clients. This plugin handles 2FA inside Jellyfin so the web UI works correctly while still requiring a second factor for browser sign-ins.

## ⚡ How it works

1. Each user opts into 2FA via `/TwoFactorAuth/Setup` — scans a QR code with an authenticator app and saves recovery codes.
2. On normal login, Jellyfin's `SessionStarted` event fires. The plugin checks if the user has 2FA enabled.
3. If yes, the plugin **blocks all subsequent API requests from that session** until the user completes 2FA via `/TwoFactorAuth/Login`.
4. After successful verification, a signed `__2fa_trust` cookie is set in the browser. **For 30 days, that browser doesn't need 2FA again** — but new browsers/devices still do.
5. The block applies regardless of how the user authenticated (Jellyfin web, mobile API, anything that creates a session).

The standard Jellyfin login page gets a small "Sign in with 2FA" button injected so users with 2FA enrolled can route directly to the plugin's login form.

---

## 🧩 Features

### Authentication
- **TOTP** (RFC 6238) compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, Microsoft Authenticator, Bitwarden, etc.
- **10 single-use recovery codes** generated at enrollment, stored as SHA-256 hashes, displayable once
- **Email OTP fallback** via configurable SMTP — codes expire in 5 minutes, single-use
- **Per-device trust** via signed HTTP-only cookie (HMAC-SHA256, 30-day expiry, `SameSite=Strict`)

### Enforcement
- Session-level enforcement via `ISessionManager.SessionStarted` — works for all clients, not just web
- API-level request blocking — even valid Jellyfin tokens get 401 until 2FA is completed
- Per-IP rate limiting on verify (10/min) and email send (5/5min)
- Per-challenge attempt limit (5 attempts before challenge is burned)
- Per-user lockout after 5 failed attempts (15-minute cool-down, configurable)
- LAN bypass (configurable CIDR ranges) so local devices can skip 2FA
- Force-2FA-for-all-users mode (admin setting)

### Security
- TOTP secrets encrypted at rest with **AES-GCM** using a persistent 32-byte key (survives restarts)
- Cookie signatures use **HMAC-SHA256** with persistent key
- Constant-time comparison for all secret material (`CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals`)
- TOTP replay prevention (used time-steps tracked per user)
- Recovery codes marked used immediately on validation (not on full login success) — stolen codes can't be retried
- Atomic file writes for user data — crash mid-write doesn't corrupt 2FA state
- Generic error messages prevent account enumeration ("invalid credentials" whether password or code is wrong)

### Native client support (v1.3.0)
- **App passwords** — generate revocable long random passwords for native apps (Swiftfin, Findroid, etc.). Stored as PBKDF2-SHA256 hashes. Users with a Jellyfin password can enter the app password in the native client's password field to bypass 2FA.
- **Device pairing** — passwordless users (no Jellyfin password) can pair native clients: the first failed login registers a "pending pairing request." The user approves it from `/TwoFactorAuth/Setup`, and the device is permanently trusted.
- **Quick Connect pass-through** — when a 2FA-verified user approves a Quick Connect code, the new device inherits the verified status. TVs sign in without a TOTP prompt.
- **Active sessions view** — users can see all their active sessions with device/IP/last-activity and sign them out individually.

### UI
- Polished login page with lockout countdown and low-recovery-code warning
- Redesigned Setup page with status dashboard, TOTP enrollment, recovery codes, email backup, pending device approvals, paired devices, app passwords, trusted browsers, and active sessions — all in one unified view
- Admin dashboard with users, devices, audit log (paginated, filterable), and settings with Test SMTP button
- Configurable TOTP issuer name (what users see in their authenticator app)
- Per-user email address management (self-service from Setup page or admin-set)
- "Sign in with 2FA" button auto-injected into Jellyfin's standard login page
- "Two-Factor Auth" sidebar entry injected into Jellyfin's navigation drawer (follows AchievementBadges' proven DOM injection pattern)
- Settings page tile so users can find Setup from their preferences

### Notifications
- Push notifications for login attempts via **ntfy** or **Gotify**
- Audit log of every 2FA-related event (1000 entries default, FIFO, 90-day prune)

---

## 🚀 First-time setup

### As an admin

1. Install the plugin from the manifest URL in **Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories → Add**, then install **Two-Factor Authentication** from the catalog and restart Jellyfin.
2. Go to **Dashboard → Plugins → Two-Factor Authentication**
3. Open the **Settings** tab and verify:
   - ✅ **Enabled** — master switch
   - ✅ **Require for all users** — off by default. When on, every user with a password must enroll (existing trusted sessions keep working). When off, 2FA is opt-in per user.
   - ✅ **LAN Bypass** — skip 2FA when the request comes from a LAN IP (192.168/16, 10/8, 172.16/12 by default). Adds convenience, reduces prompts on local devices.
   - **Email OTP** — optional fallback if a user loses their authenticator. Requires SMTP config below.
4. If you're behind a reverse proxy (Cloudflare, nginx, Caddy, Traefik):
   - Enable **Trust X-Forwarded-For**
   - Add your proxy IPs (or Cloudflare's IP ranges) to **Trusted Proxy CIDRs**
   - Without this, rate limiting collapses to a single bucket because every request looks like it comes from the proxy's loopback.
5. Optional: configure **Notifications** (Gotify, ntfy, or webhook) to get alerts when someone triggers a 2FA prompt.

### As a user (enroll in 2FA)

1. Sign in to Jellyfin normally (no 2FA yet)
2. Open **Profile → Two-Factor Authentication** (or visit `https://your-jellyfin/TwoFactorAuth/Setup`)
3. Click **Set up Authenticator App**
4. Scan the QR code with your authenticator (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
5. Enter the 6-digit code shown in the app to confirm
6. **Generate recovery codes** — you get 10 single-use codes. Save them in your password manager. Each one can sign you in if you lose your phone.
7. (Optional) Add your email under **Email OTP** if you want email as a backup factor.

### Signing in with 2FA on the web

From this point, every login from a new browser prompts for a code:

1. Sign in at `/web` with username + password as usual
2. You'll be redirected to the 2FA challenge page
3. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator
4. Done — this browser is trusted for 30 days (cookie bound to your device)

### Passkeys (v1.4) — sign in with Face ID / fingerprint / YubiKey

Passkeys replace the 6-digit code with a biometric or hardware tap. They are phishing-resistant (the credential is bound to your exact domain) and require no typing.

**Important — server config first.** Passkeys require HTTPS AND the WebAuthn Relying Party ID + origin to match the URL the browser is on. In **Dashboard → Plugins → Two-Factor Authentication → Settings → WebAuthn / passkeys**:

- **Relying Party ID**: enter your public hostname only — `jellyfin.example.com`. No `https://`, no port, no path.
- **Allowed origins**: one per line, full origin including scheme and port — e.g. `https://jellyfin.example.com` and `https://jellyfin.example.com:8096`. Add every URL users actually hit.

If you skip this, browsers will refuse to register or use passkeys (Apple Safari is the strictest).

#### Add a passkey on a desktop browser

1. Open the Setup page on the URL you configured above
2. Setup → **Passkeys** card → optionally type a label → **Add a passkey**
3. Browser prompts your platform authenticator (Windows Hello / Touch ID / a YubiKey USB key)
4. Tap / scan / confirm — the passkey is saved

#### Add a passkey on iPhone (Safari)

1. Open **Safari** and visit your Jellyfin HTTPS URL — must be the URL configured as the WebAuthn origin, not the bare LAN IP
2. Sign in with username + password + 2FA code
3. Setup → **Passkeys** → label it (e.g. "iPhone") → **Add a passkey**
4. iOS shows "Save passkey for ...?" — confirm with **Face ID / Touch ID**
5. The passkey is saved to **iCloud Keychain** and syncs to every Apple device on the same Apple ID

#### Add a passkey on Android (Chrome)

1. Open **Chrome** on Android and visit your Jellyfin HTTPS URL
2. Sign in with username + password + 2FA code
3. Setup → **Passkeys** → label it (e.g. "Pixel 8") → **Add a passkey**
4. Android shows "Save passkey to Google Password Manager?" — confirm with **fingerprint / face unlock**
5. The passkey now lives in your Google account and syncs to every Android signed in with the same Google account

**Common Android gotchas:**
- "Add a passkey" does nothing → your phone needs a screen lock (PIN/pattern/biometric). Android refuses to create passkeys without one.
- "No passkey provider available" → Settings → Passwords & accounts → Passwords → enable Google Password Manager, or set Bitwarden / 1Password as your default credential provider.
- Samsung Internet sometimes hides the passkey button — use **Chrome** instead.

#### Using a passkey to sign in

1. Visit your Jellyfin URL → enter username + password as usual
2. At the 2FA challenge page → tap **🔑 Use a passkey instead**
3. The browser prompts your authenticator → confirm with biometric / hardware key
4. You're in. No code typed.

#### What passkeys do NOT do

- **Native apps (Findroid, Streamyfin, Swiftfin, official Jellyfin app) cannot use passkeys.** WebAuthn is a browser-only API; native apps have no hook to call it. For app sign-in use **device pairing** (below) and the **app's own biometric lock** (Findroid → Settings → Biometric authentication, Swiftfin → Settings → Security → Lock with Face ID, etc.).
- Passkeys do not replace your password — they replace the **2FA code step**. You still enter username + password first.

### Native apps / TVs (Jellyfin for Tizen, Swiftfin, Jellyfin Android, etc.)

Native apps don't know how to do a 2FA flow, so the plugin uses **device pairing** instead:

1. Open the native app and sign in with your username + password
2. The app will show "Invalid" or fail to load — that's expected. The server recorded a **pending pairing** for this device.
3. On any already-trusted device (your laptop, phone browser), go to **Setup → Devices Waiting for Approval**
4. You'll see the TV/app listed. Click **Trust**.
5. Back on the TV/app, retry sign-in — it now works and is remembered permanently.

This way a TV/console/media-box that can't type a TOTP code still gets its own credential you can revoke later.

### Native apps that can't do the pairing flow (scripts, older tools)

Use **app passwords**: in Setup → App Passwords → Generate. You get a one-time shown random password. Use it in the app **in place of your Jellyfin password**. The plugin matches it via PBKDF2 hash and bypasses the 2FA prompt. Each app password can be revoked independently.

---

## 🔄 Daily use

### Web login (browser)

- On the standard Jellyfin login page, click the **🔐 Sign in with Two-Factor Authentication** button
- Enter your username, password, and 6-digit code from your app
- After first sign-in on this browser, you won't be asked for the code again for 30 days

### Mobile / TV apps (Swiftfin, Findroid, Jellyfin for Tizen, Android TV, etc.)

Use the **device pairing** flow described in [First-time setup](#-first-time-setup):
1. Sign in on the TV/mobile app with your password
2. It'll fail once — that's normal, the server recorded a pending pairing
3. Approve the device from Setup on any already-trusted browser
4. Retry on the TV/app — it now works permanently

Alternative: generate an **app password** in Setup and use it in place of your real password. Useful for older apps or anything that can't tolerate the pairing-request delay.

### Sonarr / Radarr / Overseerr / Jellyseerr

Use Jellyfin's standard API keys (Dashboard → API Keys). API key auth bypasses user authentication entirely, so 2FA doesn't apply.

---

## 🛠️ Admin guide

The admin dashboard at **Dashboard → Plugins → Two-Factor Authentication** has 5 tabs:

### Users
Per-user 2FA status: TOTP on/off, trusted device count, recovery codes remaining, email address (for OTP), lockout status.
- **Set per-user email** — for email OTP delivery (admin sets these manually)
- **Toggle 2FA on/off** — disabling wipes all 2FA state for that user (secret, codes, devices)

### Trusted Devices
Every trusted device across all users with last-used time and expiry. Revoke any to force 2FA on that browser's next login.

### Pairings
Pending TV pairing requests (currently a stub — see "Limitations" below).

### Audit Log
Paginated, filterable login attempt history. Tracks success, failures, lockouts, bypasses, and challenge issuances.

### Settings
- **General** — plugin toggle, force 2FA for all users, email OTP toggle
- **LAN Bypass** — CIDR ranges, X-Forwarded-For trust, trusted proxies
- **Security** — failed-attempt threshold, lockout duration, audit log size
- **SMTP** — host, port, SSL, credentials, from-address (required for email OTP)
- **Push Notifications** — ntfy URL/topic, Gotify URL/token, admin email addresses

---

## 📧 SMTP setup (email OTP)

Email OTP requires SMTP credentials. Common providers:

### Gmail (with app password)
```
SMTP Host: smtp.gmail.com
SMTP Port: 587
Use SSL/TLS: ✓
SMTP Username: your-email@gmail.com
SMTP Password: <generate at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords>
From Address: your-email@gmail.com
From Name: Jellyfin 2FA
```

### Generic SMTP relay
```
SMTP Host: mail.example.com
SMTP Port: 587 (STARTTLS) or 465 (implicit TLS)
Use SSL/TLS: ✓
```

### Per-user email addresses

Email OTP needs the user's email address. In **Admin → Users**, edit each user's email field. The plugin doesn't auto-pull from Jellyfin user metadata (Jellyfin's `User` entity exposes email inconsistently across versions).

---

## 🆘 Recovery — locked out

### Lost authenticator app + have recovery codes
Sign in via `/TwoFactorAuth/Login`. In the code field, enter one of your recovery codes (format: `XXXXX-XXXXX`). Click "Use a recovery code instead" if your authenticator app field is showing.

### Lost authenticator AND lost recovery codes (admin)
SSH into the Jellyfin server and edit the user data file:

```bash
# Path
/config/plugins/configurations/TwoFactorAuth/users/{userId}.json

# Set:
"TotpEnabled": false,
"TotpVerified": false,
"EncryptedTotpSecret": null,
"RecoveryCodes": [],
"TrustedDevices": []
```

Restart Jellyfin. The user can now log in normally and re-enroll.

### Plugin breaking your server
Disable the plugin without uninstalling:

```bash
# Edit
/config/plugins/configurations/Jellyfin.Plugin.TwoFactorAuth.xml

# Set
<Enabled>false</Enabled>
```

Restart Jellyfin. All 2FA enforcement turns off; users can log in normally.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The plugin uses **5 ASP.NET Core middleware** components plus an `ISessionManager.SessionStarted` event handler:

1. **`IndexHtmlInjectionMiddleware`** — injects the "Sign in with 2FA" button script into Jellyfin's `index.html`
2. **`TrustCookieMiddleware`** — checks the `__2fa_trust` cookie on auth requests; if valid, marks the user as pre-verified for the upcoming session
3. **`TwoFactorEnforcementMiddleware`** — inspects responses from auth endpoints (catches the auth response shape regardless of which Jellyfin route was used)
4. **`RequestBlockerMiddleware`** — blocks API requests from authenticated users who haven't completed 2FA yet (returns 401)
5. **`AuthenticationEventHandler`** (hosted service) — subscribes to `SessionStarted`; if a session for a 2FA-enabled user starts without verification, the user is added to the blocker's blocklist

Persistent state:
- `users/{userId}.json` — per-user TOTP secret (AES-GCM encrypted), recovery codes (SHA-256 hashed), trusted devices, lockout state
- `secret.key` — 32-byte AES-GCM key for TOTP secret encryption
- `cookie.key` — 32-byte HMAC-SHA256 key for trust cookie signing
- `audit.json` — login attempt log

All file writes use atomic write-then-rename so crashes mid-write don't corrupt user state.

## 🔒 Security model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Stolen password (no 2FA bypass) | All sessions blocked until 2FA completed; correct password alone gives 401 on every API call |
| TOTP brute force on the 6-digit code space | Per-IP rate limit (10/min on verify, 10/min on auth), per-challenge attempt limit (5), per-user lockout (5 failures → 15min) |
| Stolen recovery code | Marked used immediately on validation regardless of password outcome — can't be retried |
| Stolen trust cookie | HMAC-SHA256 signed with persistent server-side key; HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict; tied to a server-side trust record (revocable) |
| Account enumeration | Identical "invalid credentials" message whether password is wrong, user doesn't exist, or 2FA code is wrong |
| Disk corruption mid-write | Atomic write-then-rename for all user state files |
| TOTP secret theft from disk | AES-GCM encrypted with persistent 32-byte key |
| Replay attacks on TOTP | Used time-steps tracked per user |
| Timing attacks | `CryptographicOperations.FixedTimeEquals` on all secret comparisons |
| Service integrations breaking | Standard Jellyfin API keys bypass user auth — Sonarr/Radarr unaffected |
| Authelia/Authentik breaking native apps | Native plugin, no proxy dependency |

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Mobile apps (Swiftfin, Findroid)** — these don't support a 2FA flow yet. Workaround: do a 2FA login via web on the same device first; mobile clients can then use the resulting session token. A native mobile flow requires app-side changes.
- **TV pairing flow** — backend exists, no TV-side UI yet. Use trusted device tokens or admin pre-registration of device IDs.
- **Quick Connect** — works as Jellyfin's normal flow but creates a session subject to 2FA enforcement (user will be blocked until they complete 2FA via `/TwoFactorAuth/Login`).
- **Email OTP requires admin to set per-user email** — Jellyfin's user entity doesn't expose email consistently across versions, so admins enter emails in the Users tab.
- **Cookie isn't bound to IP** — a stolen trust cookie works from any IP for 30 days, within the signed deviceId. Revoke the device in admin if a browser is compromised.

---

## 📝 Changelog

### 1.4.0 — Passkeys + safety net

**New factors**
- **Passkeys / WebAuthn** as a 2nd-factor option. Sign in with Face ID, Windows Hello, Touch ID, a YubiKey, or any FIDO2 authenticator. Phishing-resistant (signature is bound to your domain). Add and remove passkeys from Setup → Passkeys. Passkey verification replaces the OTP step at the 2FA challenge — username + password still happen first.

**User self-service**
- **"I lost my phone" emergency lockout** — single button on Setup. Terminates every session, revokes every trusted/paired device, requires recovery code or email OTP to sign back in.
- **TOTP secret rotation** — replace your authenticator seed without admin involvement (current code + a recovery code).
- **Recovery codes PDF + print** — download as PDF or print directly from the browser instead of the .txt download.
- **QR-pair-from-phone** — Setup page renders a QR an already-signed-in phone can scan to add this browser as a paired device. Reverse direction of the existing TV pairing.
- **`autocomplete="one-time-code"`** on the OTP input — iOS picks codes from Messages.

**Admin tools**
- **Overview / adoption dashboard** — % enrolled, recent enrollments, failed verifies + lockouts in last 24h, users past the configured enrollment deadline.
- **Diagnostics tab** — run a green/red checklist (signing keys readable, audit chain intact, IAuthenticationProvider registered, recovery hash format upgrade complete, GeoIP DBs loaded, etc.).
- **Rate-limit observability** — see when buckets trip, key by key, since last restart.
- **Bulk user actions** — disable 2FA / rotate recovery / revoke paired / revoke trusted / force logout, applied across N users at once.
- **User search + filter** in the Users tab.
- **Force-logout user** button per row — kills every session, clears trust state.
- **Per-user GDPR export** — JSON dump of everything we have on file (no secrets).
- **Webhook events** — POST `{event, user, ip, timestamp, payload}` to any URL. Optional HMAC-SHA256 signature header (`X-2FA-Signature: sha256=...`) computed over `<unix-timestamp>.<body>`. The unix timestamp is also exposed as `X-2FA-Timestamp` so receivers can do replay/skew checks without parsing the JSON body. Events: lockout, new device, recovery used, suspicious login, passkey registered, TOTP rotated, emergency lockout, admin force-logout.<br><br>**Privacy note:** webhook payloads include the username, source IP, device name, and (for suspicious-login events) ASN + country code. Don't send webhooks to a third-party service you wouldn't share that data with. The plugin refuses to dispatch to RFC1918, loopback, link-local (incl. cloud metadata 169.254/16) or IPv6 private/link-local addresses as a basic SSRF guard.
- **Suspicious-login alerts** — first sign-in from a never-seen ASN/country fires a notification. Requires admin to drop free MaxMind GeoLite2 .mmdb files into the config dir (paths configurable in Settings).

**Security & integrity**
- **Audit log hash chain** — each entry's hash chains the previous, so silent tampering with `audit.json` is detectable. The Diagnostics tab verifies the chain on demand.
- **Per-user concurrent-session cap** — admin sets a default and per-user override; oldest non-paired sessions get evicted when over the limit.
- **NAT-hairpin self-IP bypass** (opt-in) — admin can have the plugin auto-discover the server's public IP at startup and treat hairpinned requests as LAN. Documented with an explicit warning about the IoT/guest-WiFi blast radius.

**Tunables**
- Pre-verify window (the brief allowance after a successful verify so follow-up sessions go through) — configurable 30s–900s.
- Trust cookie TTL — configurable 1d–90d.
- Optional enrollment deadline — flagged on the Overview dashboard.

**New dependencies bundled** (Linux x64 native libs included; Windows / macOS users currently need Docker or to manually supply `libsodium`):
- Fido2NetLib (MIT) — FIDO2 / WebAuthn server-side
- MaxMind.Db (Apache 2.0) — offline ASN/country lookup
- QuestPDF (Community license — free under USD 1M revenue) — recovery-codes PDF render

### 1.3.3 — Security hardening

**Critical fixes**
- Trust cookie now signs the `deviceId` and expiry into the payload. A stolen cookie can no longer be replayed with an attacker-chosen `X-Emby-Device-Id` header (device substitution bypass). Cookie rotates on every use.
- Token-approval race between the SessionStarted event handler and response-intercept middleware is now bound to `(userId, deviceId, token)` and single-consume — closes a narrow timing window that could leak a bypass.
- Recovery codes upgraded from plain SHA-256 to PBKDF2-SHA256 (100k iters, per-code salt). Legacy codes still validate seamlessly; new generations write the hardened format.
- Open redirect in `/TwoFactorAuth/Challenge?return=` closed — same-origin check with `javascript:` / `data:` / `file:` rejection.

**High-severity fixes**
- `PairedDevice` / `TrustedDevice` `deviceId` comparisons are now case-sensitive (`Ordinal`). Previously `OrdinalIgnoreCase` allowed case-variant bypass.
- Pairing approve refuses records with `Guid.Empty` user or empty `deviceId` (phantom-user write prevention).
- `RegisteredDeviceIds` capped at 50 per user with 128-char printable-ASCII validation — no more storage-inflation DoS.
- `IsAuthPath` is now anchored to `^/Users/…` instead of substring `Contains` — closes a confused-deputy path where a third-party plugin's response could be rewritten as a 2FA challenge.
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `CSP frame-ancestors 'none'`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on all embedded pages (anti-clickjacking).
- Rate limiter is now reverse-proxy aware via `TrustForwardedFor` + `TrustedProxyCidrs`. IPv6 is bucketed by `/64` to prevent host-rotation bypass.
- `/Verify` now has a per-user rate limit (15 per 15 min) in addition to per-IP.
- `/Pairings/Initiate` input (`Username`, `DeviceName`) sanitized against control characters and HTML-significant bytes; length-capped at 64.

**Medium-severity fixes**
- `inject.js` redirects to a hardcoded `/TwoFactorAuth/Challenge?token=…` path instead of trusting the server body's `ChallengePageUrl`.
- `TestSmtp` admin endpoint no longer echoes `ex.Message` — full detail goes to server logs.
- Device revocation (both paired and trusted) wipes in-memory pre-verified flags and calls `Logout(accessToken)` on any live session for that device.
- `PairConfirm` records a short-TTL seen-signature set — the same signed pairing token can only be used once.
- API keys are now stored as SHA-256 hash + short preview. Raw key is shown once on create. Legacy plaintext keys auto-migrate on first load; the API key listing never returns the raw secret.
- `CookieSigner.Verify` length-checks signatures before `FixedTimeEquals` to eliminate the throw/non-throw timing oracle.

**Quality of life**
- Settings tile now renders inline with Profile/Quick Connect/Display under the user section of themed drawers (JellyFlare, StarTrack, KefinTweaks). Previously appeared in a floating bottom-left position.
- Dev-only log chatter moved to Debug. Info/Warn retained only for audit-worthy events (challenge issued, bypass applied, lockout, paired device added/revoked).
- LAN bypass now auto-registers the `deviceId` and clears stale pending pairings for the same device — browsers that alternate between LAN and Cloudflare (NAT hairpin) no longer accumulate pending entries.

### 1.3.2

- Fixed DI circular dependency when registering `IAuthenticationProvider` (`TwoFactorAuthProvider` now resolves `IUserManager` lazily via `IApplicationHost`).
- Samsung Tizen / Jellyfin for Tizen pairing works end-to-end.
- Login loop fixed by removing access-token blocking — middleware response-intercept is now the only gate.
